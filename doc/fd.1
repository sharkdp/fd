.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fd
is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to
.BR find (1).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-hidden
Include hidden files and directories in the search results
(default: hidden files and directories are skipped).
.TP
.B \-I, \-\-no\-ignore
Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by
.IR .gitignore ,
.IR .ignore ,
.IR .fdignore ,
or the global ignore file.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unrestricted
Alias for '--no-ignore'. Can be repeated; '-uu' is an alias for '--no-ignore --hidden'.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-ignore\-vcs
Show search results from files and directories that would otherwise be ignored by
.I .gitignore
files.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-case\-sensitive
Perform a case-sensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the
pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-ignore\-case
Perform a case-insensitive search. By default, fd uses case-insensitive searches, unless the
pattern contains an uppercase character (smart case).
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-glob
Perform a glob-based search instead of a regular expression search.
.TP
.B \-\-regex
Perform a regular-expression based seach (default). This can be used to override --glob.
.TP
.B \-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-absolute\-path
Shows the full path starting from the root as opposed to relative paths.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list\-details
Use a detailed listing format like 'ls -l'. This is basically an alias
for '--exec-batch ls -l' with some additional 'ls' options. This can be used
to see more metadata, to show symlink targets and to achieve a deterministic
sort order.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-follow
By default, fd does not descend into symlinked directories. Using this flag, symbolic links are
also traversed.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-full\-path
By default, the search pattern is only matched against the filename (or directory name). Using
this flag, the
.I pattern
is matched against the full path.
.TP
.B \-0, \-\-print0
Separate search results by the null character (instead of newlines). Useful for piping results to
.IR xargs .
.TP
.B \-\-max\-results count
Limit the number of search results to 'count' and quit immediately.
.TP
.B \-1
Limit the search to a single result and quit immediately. This is an alias for '--max-results=1'.
.TP
.B \-\-show-errors
Enable the display of filesystem errors for situations such as insufficient
permissions or dead symlinks.
.TP
.B \-\-one\-file\-system, \-\-mount, \-\-xdev
By default, fd will traverse the file system tree as far as other options dictate. With this flag, fd ensures that it does not descend into a different file system than the one it started in. Comparable to the -mount or -xdev filters of find(1).
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information.
.TP
.BI "\-d, \-\-max\-depth " d
Limit directory traversal to at most
.I d
levels of depth. By default, there is no limit on the search depth.
.TP
.BI "\-\-min\-depth " d
Only show search results starting at the given depth. See also: '--max-depth' and '--exact-depth'.
.TP
.BI "\-\-exact\-depth " d
Only show search results at the exact given depth. This is an alias for '--min-depth <depth> --max-depth <depth>'.
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-type " filetype
Filter search by type:
.RS
.IP "f, file"
regular files
.IP "d, directory"
directories
.IP "l, symlink"
symbolic links
.IP "x, executable"
executable (files)
.IP "e, empty"
empty files or directories
.IP "s, socket"
sockets
.IP "p, pipe"
named pipes (FIFOs)
.RE

.RS
This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple file types.
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-extension " ext
Filter search results by file extension
.IR ext .
This option can be used repeatedly to allow for multiple possible file extensions.
.TP
.BI "\-E, \-\-exclude " pattern
Exclude files/directories that match the given glob pattern.
This overrides any other ignore logic.
Multiple exclude patterns can be specified.
.TP
.BI "\-\-ignore-file " path
Add a custom ignore-file in '.gitignore' format.
These files have a low precedence.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-color " when
Declare
.I when
to colorize search results:
.RS
.IP auto
Colorize output when standard output is connected to terminal (default).
.IP never
Do not colorize output.
.IP always
Always colorize output.
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-j, \-\-threads " num
Set number of threads to use for searching & executing (default: number of available CPU cores).
.TP
.BI "\-S, \-\-size " size
Limit results based on the size of files using the format
.I <+-><NUM><UNIT>
.RS
.IP '+'
file size must be greater than or equal to this
.IP '-'
file size must be less than or equal to this
.IP 'NUM'
The numeric size (e.g. 500)
.IP 'UNIT'
The units for NUM. They are not case-sensitive.
Allowed unit values:
.RS
.IP 'b'
bytes
.IP 'k'
kilobytes
.IP 'm'
megabytes
.IP 'g'
gigabytes
.IP 't'
terabytes
.IP 'ki'
kibibytes
.IP 'mi'
mebibytes
.IP 'gi'
gibibytes
.IP 'ti'
tebibytes
.RE
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-\-changed-within " date|duration
Filter results based on the file modification time. The argument can be provided as a specific
point in time (\fIYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\fR) or as a duration (\fI10h, 1d, 35min\fR).
.B --change-newer-than
can be used as an alias.

Examples:
  \-\-changed-within 2weeks
  \-\-change-newer-than "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
.TP
.BI "\-\-changed-before " date|duration
Filter results based on the file modification time. The argument can be provided as a specific
point in time (\fIYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\fR) or as a duration (\fI10h, 1d, 35min\fR).
.B --change-older-than
can be used as an alias.

Examples:
  \-\-changed-before "2018-10-27 10:00:00"
  \-\-change-older-than 2weeks
.TP
.BI "-o, \-\-owner " [user][:group]
Filter files by their user and/or group. Format: [(user|uid)][:(group|gid)]. Either side
is optional. Precede either side with a '!' to exclude files instead.

Examples:
  \-\-owner john
  \-\-owner :students
  \-\-owner "!john:students"
.TP
.BI "\-x, \-\-exec " command
Execute
.I command
for each search result. The following placeholders are substituted by a path derived from the current search result:
.RS
.IP {}
path
.IP {/}
basename
.IP {//}
parent directory
.IP {.}
path without file extension
.IP {/.}
basename without file extension
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-X, \-\-exec-batch " command
Execute
.I command
with all search results at once.
A single occurence of the following placeholders is authorized and substituted by the paths derived from the search results before the command is executed:
.RS
.IP {}
path
.IP {/}
basename
.IP {//}
parent directory
.IP {.}
path without file extension
.IP {/.}
basename without file extension
